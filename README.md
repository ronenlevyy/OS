Assignment 1
The program expects a single argument and executes itself with this argument. It then initializes its execution environment (including setting up memory space and necessary resources).
Next, it creates a directory named "Welcome" with three files within it:
- The first file named "Welcome" and the program writes "karin.lein\nIf you haven't read this yet, start now!" to the file.
- The second file named "To" and the program writes "Start exercises early!" to the file.
- The third file named "OS-2024" and the program writes "Good luck!" to the file.
Finally, the program closes all the files after writing, deletes them and the directory "Welcome" and exits with the exit code 0.
